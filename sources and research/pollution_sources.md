# Comprehensive Pollution Source Data for ML Projects in Asia

This research provides a complete guide to accessing pollution source data across Asia (India, China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam and other countries) from 2015-2025, covering all major emission sources with ML-ready APIs and datasets. The findings include emission inventories, real-time monitoring, satellite observations, and model outputs that can be spatially matched to air quality monitoring stations.

## Emission Inventory Databases: The Foundation for Comprehensive Coverage

The most comprehensive pollution data comes from gridded emission inventory databases that provide systematic coverage of all emission sources.

### EDGAR v8.0 - Global Coverage with Asian Detail

**[EDGAR (Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research)](https://data.jrc.ec.europa.eu/collection/EDGAR)** from the European Commission provides the most comprehensive global coverage at 0.1° × 0.1° resolution (~11 km). The database covers 1970-2022 with annual and monthly data for CO₂, NOₓ, SO₂, PM₂.₅, and other pollutants across all sectors including power generation, industry, transport, residential, and agriculture. Access is completely free through direct HTTP download of NetCDF files from the JRC Data Catalogue.

### MEIC - Highest Resolution for China

**[MEIC (Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China)](http://meicmodel.org.cn/?page_id=125&lang=en)** from Tsinghua University offers the highest resolution data for China, with options down to 1 km resolution. It covers 1990-2021 with continuous updates and includes approximately 800 anthropogenic sources. The system provides a web-based calculation platform with RESTful API access. Registration is required but free for academic use.

### Regional Asian Inventories

**[REAS v3.2.1 (Regional Emission inventory in ASia)](https://www.nies.go.jp/REAS/)** provides specialized Asian coverage from 1950-2015 at 0.25° × 0.25° resolution. Developed by Japan's National Institute for Environmental Studies, it offers detailed sectoral breakdowns specific to Asian emission patterns.

**[MIX-Asia v2](http://meicmodel.org.cn/?page_id=87&lang=en)** offers harmonized data from multiple inventories at 0.1° × 0.1° resolution for 2010-2017. This mosaic approach combines the best available national inventories, ensuring consistency across borders. Both databases are freely downloadable as NetCDF files.

## Fire and Biomass Burning: Real-Time Satellite Monitoring

Fire emissions contribute significantly to Asian air pollution, particularly during agricultural burning seasons.

### NASA FIRMS - Comprehensive Fire Detection

**[NASA FIRMS (Fire Information for Resource Management System)](https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/)** provides the most comprehensive fire data through:

- **MODIS**: 2000-present, 1 km resolution, twice-daily coverage
- **VIIRS**: 2012-present, 375 m resolution, improved small fire detection

The system offers real-time data within 3 hours of satellite overpass. Key features include Fire Radiative Power (FRP) for emission estimation, confidence levels (low/nominal/high), and precise coordinates. Access requires free MAP_KEY registration through the [FIRMS API portal](https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/api/).

### Agricultural Burning Detection

For agricultural burning specifically, the VIIRS 375m resolution product (VNP14IMG) achieves 80% detection rate for fires larger than 14 hectares. This is crucial for monitoring crop residue burning in:
- **Punjab and Haryana, India**: October-November rice stubble burning
- **North China Plain**: June wheat residue burning
- **Southeast Asia**: Year-round shifting cultivation burns

## Industrial and Power Plant Emissions: Point Source Precision

- **Annual**: Emission inventories, PRTR reports

## Regional Considerations and Data Quality

### Data Availability by Country

**Best coverage**: China, Japan, South Korea
- Extensive monitoring networks
- Multiple emission inventories
- Real-time data access

**Good coverage**: India, Taiwan, Singapore
- Growing monitoring infrastructure
- National inventories available
- Some real-time capabilities

**Limited coverage**: Southeast Asia (except Singapore)
- Reliance on satellite data
- Regional inventories (REAS, MIX-Asia)
- Few ground monitoring stations

### Known Limitations

- Industrial emissions often self-reported
- Small sources (<1 MW) frequently missing
- Residential emissions highly uncertain
- Temporal allocation assumes standard profiles
- Cross-border transport requires modeling

## Recommended Data Combination Strategy

For comprehensive ML applications in Asia:

1. **Base layer**: EDGAR or MIX-Asia gridded inventories
2. **Enhancement**: Real-time CEMS data where available
3. **Fire emissions**: NASA FIRMS with agricultural calendar
4. **Traffic dynamics**: Google Traffic API or local alternatives
5. **Natural sources**: CAMS reanalysis and dust forecasts
6. **Validation**: OpenAQ ground measurements

This multi-source approach ensures complete coverage while leveraging the strengths of each dataset. The combination provides sufficient spatial and temporal resolution for advanced ML applications in air quality prediction and policy analysis.
