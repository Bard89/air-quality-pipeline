# ML Model Integration TODO

## Data Pipeline Design

- [ ] Design analysis pipeline for feeding spatial data regions into ML models
- [ ] Define optimal data area/boundary selection for model inputs
- [ ] Determine aggregation strategies for multi-source environmental data

## Spatial Data Considerations

- [ ] Define radius/grid size for location-based feature extraction
- [ ] Implement spatial interpolation for sparse sensor networks
- [ ] Design temporal-spatial feature windows (e.g., 48hr history, 50km radius)

## Feature Engineering

- [ ] Combine elevation data with meteorological features
- [ ] Extract upwind/downwind features from wind direction data
- [ ] Create pollution transport features from trajectory analysis

## Model Input Format

- [ ] Standardize multi-source data into unified feature vectors
- [ ] Handle missing data and sensor outages
- [ ] Design efficient data loading for large spatial datasets
