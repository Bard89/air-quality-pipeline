# Weather Data Sources for ML Projects in Asia: A Comprehensive Guide

Pairing weather data with air quality measurements is essential for building accurate ML models in Asia. This research identifies the best weather data sources that provide comprehensive meteorological parameters, historical coverage from 2016-2025, and easy integration with air quality monitoring stations across India, China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, and other Asian countries.

The most valuable finding is that **ERA5 reanalysis** combined with **NASA POWER** provides an optimal balance of high-resolution data, comprehensive parameters, and free access. ERA5 offers superior 0.25° spatial resolution with hourly data from 1940 to present, while NASA POWER provides an easier entry point with no registration required and simple REST API access. For ML projects requiring both accuracy and ease of implementation, this combination delivers the best results.

## Best Weather Data Sources Ranked by ML Suitability

## Practical Implementation Guide

### Data Access Steps

1. **Start with NASA POWER** for immediate access and prototyping
2. **Register for ERA5** through Copernicus CDS for comprehensive historical data
3. **Add regional sources** where available (especially JMA for Japan, KMA for Korea)
4. **Consider commercial APIs** for real-time operational needs

### Matching Weather Data to Air Quality Stations

Weather data typically comes in gridded format while air quality stations are point locations. Common approaches include:

- **Nearest neighbor**: Use the closest grid point to each station
- **Bilinear interpolation**: Weight by distance from four surrounding grid points
- **Kriging**: Advanced statistical method that models spatial correlation

### Storage Planning

For a typical ML project covering major Asian cities:
- 10 weather variables at hourly resolution: 10-20 GB per year
- Compression can reduce this by 50-80%
- ERA5 for 5 years over Asia: 50-100 GB

### Temporal Considerations

- Most air quality data is hourly or daily
- Weather data should be resampled to match
- Consider time zone differences across Asia
- Account for data update latency (ERA5: 5 days, POWER: 1-2 days)
