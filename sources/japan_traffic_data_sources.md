# Free sources of hourly historical traffic data for Japan

Finding free hourly historical traffic data for Japan covering 2023-2024 presents significant challenges. While Japan has extensive traffic monitoring infrastructure, most systems prioritize real-time operations over historical research access. After comprehensive research across government portals, academic institutions, and open data initiatives, here are the most viable options and workarounds for obtaining this data.

## Government open data portals offer limited historical access

The **Japan Road Traffic Information Center (JARTIC)** operates the most comprehensive traffic monitoring system in Japan, collecting data from approximately 2,600 observation points nationwide. Their open data portal (https://www.jartic.or.jp/service/opendata/) provides cross-sectional traffic volume data with 5-minute intervals that can be aggregated to hourly. However, JARTIC only retains **3 months of historical data** through their free API, making it unsuitable for accessing 2023-2024 data retrospectively.

The **Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT)** conducts the National Road Traffic Census every 5 years, with the latest available from 2021. While this census includes 24-hour breakdown data with hourly segments, it doesn't provide the continuous 2023-2024 coverage needed. The data is freely available at https://www.mlit.go.jp/road/census/r3/ in CSV and Excel formats without registration requirements.

Local government portals from major cities like **Tokyo, Osaka, and Yokohama** primarily offer the same census data or limited traffic surveys. Tokyo's open data catalog (https://catalog.data.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/) includes some traffic volume statistics, but most datasets are from 2015-2021, not the required timeframe.

## Academic datasets remain largely inaccessible

Japanese universities conduct extensive transportation research, but publicly available datasets with hourly granularity for 2023-2024 are **extremely rare**. The University of Tokyo, Kyoto University, and Tokyo Institute of Technology maintain transportation research departments but don't offer open access to recent traffic datasets through their institutional repositories.

The **Honda LOKI dataset** from Honda Research Institute provides vehicle trajectory data for central Tokyo but requires university affiliation and focuses on autonomous driving research rather than traffic volume data. The **Hanshin Expressway ZTD** (https://zen-traffic-data.net/english/) offers one-hour traffic datasets but covers only three specific expressway sections in the Osaka area with unclear availability for 2023-2024.

Most academic traffic data remains behind institutional access requirements or is embedded within published research papers without direct data access. The J-STAGE Data repository (https://jstagedata.jst.go.jp/) hosts research-associated datasets but contains limited traffic-specific data.

## Open APIs focus on real-time rather than historical data

Japan lacks a comprehensive open traffic data API equivalent to international initiatives like OpenTraffic. The **JARTIC Open Traffic API** (https://www.jartic-open-traffic.org/) provides nationwide coverage through a free REST API with JSON/GeoJSON formats, but historical data retention is limited to 1 month for 5-minute data and 3 months for hourly aggregations.

**Project LINKS**, MLIT's interdisciplinary data exchange initiative, integrates with the Public Transportation Open Data Center but focuses primarily on transit rather than road traffic data. While it provides GTFS and GTFS-RT formats for public transportation, it doesn't include historical road traffic volumes.

Smart city initiatives in Tokyo, Osaka, and other major cities have deployed thousands of traffic sensors, but the data remains largely internal for city management purposes with **limited public API access**. Tokyo allocated ¥350 billion in 2023 for AI-driven traffic management at 2,000+ intersections, but this infrastructure primarily serves operational needs rather than research data access.

## Alternative proxy data sources provide partial solutions

Given the limitations of direct traffic data, several proxy sources can indicate hourly traffic patterns:

**Public transit ridership data** from the Public Transportation Open Data Center (ODPT) offers the most comprehensive alternative. This platform provides real-time and historical data from JR companies, metro systems, and municipal transit operators in GTFS format. Since public transit usage inversely correlates with road traffic during peak hours, this data can serve as a useful proxy. Access requires free developer registration at odpt.org.

**Highway operator data** from NEXCO (East/Central/West) provides traffic information for Japan's 30,625 km expressway network. While primarily real-time focused, NEXCO platforms offer some historical patterns and hourly traffic counts at toll gates through their public interfaces (e-nexco.co.jp, c-nexco.co.jp, w-nexco.co.jp).

**GPS probe data** from navigation apps like Jyutai Navi (Japan's "Waze") collects 30 million GPS records daily nationwide. While the full dataset requires commercial licensing, some aggregated patterns may be available through research partnerships. This represents the most accurate proxy for actual vehicle movements.

**Mobile phone location data** from providers like NTT DOCOMO offers anonymized population movement patterns with hourly granularity. While primarily commercial, some data becomes available through smart city initiatives and public-private partnerships.

## Japanese open data initiatives show promise but gaps remain

Japan's open data ecosystem includes several promising initiatives that partially address traffic data needs. The **G-Spatial Information Center**, managed by AIGID since 2016, hosts over 60,000 geospatial datasets from 500+ organizations. However, comprehensive hourly traffic data for 2023-2024 requires their paid service at ¥220,000 annually.

The annual **Public Transportation Open Data Challenge** releases datasets during competition periods, though these focus on transit rather than road traffic. Some historical competition data remains accessible, providing indirect traffic indicators through ridership patterns.

A notable workaround involves **third-party data preservation**. The website compusophia.com archives historical JARTIC data that would otherwise be lost during monthly updates, potentially providing access to older data no longer available through official channels.

## Research methods reveal data combination strategies

Researchers studying traffic-air pollution relationships in Japan have developed several strategies to obtain hourly traffic data. The most successful approach, demonstrated in the 2023 RIETI study by Nishitateno et al., combines three primary sources:

The **2015 Road Traffic Census** remains the most commonly used public dataset, providing nationwide hourly traffic volumes. Available at https://www.mlit.go.jp/road/census/h27/, it includes location-specific basic tables and hourly traffic volume tables in CSV format. Despite being from 2015, researchers continue using this as the most recent comprehensive public source.

Researchers increasingly rely on **probe vehicle data** from GPS-equipped vehicles for real-time traffic state estimation. Studies show these systems have "become popular in Japan" with enormous daily data storage. Integration with fixed detector data and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System) probes improves spatiotemporal traffic density estimation accuracy.

**Multi-source data integration** represents the most practical approach. Researchers combine traffic census data with air quality monitoring stations and meteorological data using geographic location matching. This methodology creates panel datasets at the monitoring station-hour level, enabling analysis despite incomplete traffic coverage.

## Practical recommendations for accessing 2023-2024 hourly data

Based on this research, obtaining free hourly historical traffic data for Japan covering 2023-2024 requires a **combination approach** rather than a single source:

**Immediate options** include utilizing JARTIC's current API to begin collecting data going forward while accessing archived JARTIC data through third-party preservation services for historical coverage. Combine this with the 2015 Road Traffic Census for baseline hourly patterns, adjusting for temporal changes using proxy indicators.

**Proxy data integration** offers the most comprehensive coverage by combining ODPT public transit data (high inverse correlation with road traffic), NEXCO highway traffic patterns (direct traffic measurement for intercity routes), mobile phone movement patterns where available through partnerships, and environmental sensor data from smart city deployments that correlate with traffic density.

**Direct outreach** to Japanese institutions may yield additional access. Contact MLIT's Road Bureau to inquire about archived 2023-2024 data not available through public APIs, establish research partnerships with transportation engineering departments at major universities, and explore data sharing agreements with regional governments operating traffic monitoring systems.

**Commercial alternatives** should be evaluated if free sources prove insufficient. The G-Spatial Information Center's paid API (¥220,000/year) provides the most comprehensive hourly historical data. Some researchers report success negotiating academic discounts or limited-scope access for specific research projects.

## Conclusion

While Japan operates extensive traffic monitoring infrastructure, **free access to hourly historical traffic data for 2023-2024 faces significant limitations**. The combination of short data retention periods, infrequent comprehensive surveys, and focus on operational rather than research needs creates gaps in publicly available historical data. Researchers must employ creative combinations of direct traffic measurements, proxy indicators, and multi-source integration to reconstruct hourly traffic patterns for this period. The most reliable approach involves combining available government data with transit ridership patterns, highway operator statistics, and smart city sensor data while potentially supplementing with targeted commercial data purchases for critical coverage gaps.
